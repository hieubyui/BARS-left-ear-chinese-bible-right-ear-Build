# Overview

My second game in Unity. I wanted to make a game by myself. Whenever I got stuck, I would look up on the internet for a solution.

You play as a bird that has to traverse through pipes. Each traversal awards you one point. Hitting the pipe ends the game and lets you Play Again. The game has a UI, takes in user input, and is able to be looped.

I wrote this software because I wanted to make a 2D space game. Through this process, I learned so much about Unity. 
Things I have accomplished in this journey:
* Add and manipulate audio in Unity
* Layer editors and sorting layers
* Adding a background
