# Overview
You play as a cube traversing through space.
You have to dodge dangerous obstacles and reach the finish line.

They are also auditory obstacles you must overcome.

My second game in Unity. I wanted to make a game by myself. Whenever I got stuck, I would look up on the internet for a solution.

I wrote this software because I wanted to make a 2D space game. Through this process, I learned so much about Unity and game making. 
Things I have accomplished in this journey:
* Add and manipulate audio in Unity, using audio reverb zones
* Layer editors and sorting layers
* Adding a background
